## Supported payment methods

See MultiSafepay Docs – [PrestaShop 1.6](https://docs.multisafepay.com/docs/prestashop-1-6) > Payment methods.

## Prerequisites

- You will need a [MultiSafepay account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup). Consider a test account first.
- PrestaShop version 1.6 (tested on PHP version 5.6).

## Installation and configuration

### Via the PrestaShop backoffice
1. Sign in to your PrestaShop 1.6 backoffice.
2. Go to **Modules and Services**.
3. Click on "Add a new module" in the top right corner.
4. Upload the zipfile of the module you want to install.
**Note:** Upload, install and configure the MultiSafepay core module (MultiSafepay) first.
All payment methods require certain settings from the core module.

### Via FTP/SFTP
1. Unpack the zipfiles and upload them via SFTP to the PrestaShop modules directory.
2. Sign in to your PrestaShop 1.6 backoffice.
3. Go to **Modules and services** and search for MultiSafepay.
    **Note:** You must install and configure the MultiSafepay Core Module (MultiSafepay) first because all payment methods require certain settings and/or the API key in the core module.
4. In the next screen, proceed with the installation.
5. Enter your API key, and then click **Save**.
6. Go back to the list of payment gateways and install the other modules.
