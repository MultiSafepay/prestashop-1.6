Easily integrate MultiSafepay payment solutions into your PrestaShop 1.6 webshop with our free plugin.

## About MultiSafepay 

MultiSafepay is a collecting payment service provider, which means we take care of electronic contracts, technical details, and payment collection for each payment method. You can start selling online today and manage all your transactions in one place.

## Supported payment methods

See MultiSafepay Docs – [PrestaShop 1.6](https://docs.multisafepay.com/docs/prestashop-1-6) > Payment methods.

## Prerequisites

- You will need a [MultiSafepay account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup). Consider a test account first.
- PrestaShop version 1.6

## Installation and configuration

1. Unpack the contents of the .zip archive and upload the **Modules** folder via SFTP to the PrestaShop root directoy, merging the two folders.
2. Sign in to your PrestaShop 1.6 backend.
3. Go to **Modules and services** > **Payments and gateways**.
    **Note:** You must install and configure the MultiSafepay Core Module (MultiSafepay) because all payment methods require certain settings and/or the API key in the core module.
4. In the next screen, proceed with the installation.
5. Enter your API key, and then click **Save**.
6. On the **Payments** tab, enable the relevant payment methods.
